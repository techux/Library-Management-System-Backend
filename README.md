This is a simple Library Management System developed using **Node.js**. It has two main perspectives: **Reader** and **Librarian**.

### Reader Perspective:
- **Borrow Books**: Readers can borrow books available in the library.
- **Return Books**: Readers can return borrowed books when theyâ€™re done.
- **Search Books**: Readers can search for books based on various criteria.
- **View Borrowed Books**: Readers can see a list of books they have borrowed and their borrowing history.
- **Account Deletion**: If desired, readers can delete their accounts from the system.

### Librarian Perspective:
- **Manage Books**: Librarians can add new books to the system, search for existing books, and delete books from the collection.
- **Manage Readers**: Librarians have the ability to view all registered readers, modify reader information, and add or delete readers from the system.

This system streamlines library operations by allowing both readers and librarians to perform essential tasks efficiently.

## Tech Used
- **Node.js**: Node.js is used as the primary runtime environment.
- **Express.js**: Express.js was used as the web framework to handle HTTP requests and responses.
- **MongoDB Atlas**: MongoDB was used as the database to store data.
- **Cloudinary**: to upload and host files on cloud
